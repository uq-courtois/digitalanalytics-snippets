### EXERCISE 12a - A harder exercise...

# Print the first five urls that contain an .au domain form the list urls

# TIP 1: use a variable 'count' that starts with a value 0 at the beginning of the script
# The count variable should update itself with +1 per RELEVANT iteration to keep count of the number of RELEVANT iterations
# count += 1 (=> is adding 1 to the original value of the variable)

# TIP 2: if 'break' is used in a for loop, the loops terminates immediately

urls = [
"www.abc.net.au/",
"www.cnn.com/",
"10play.com.au/",
"www.freeview.com.au/",
"www.freeview.com.au/",
"www.bbc.co.uk/",
"www.ariacharts.com.au/",
"www.9now.com.au/",
"www.yourtv.com.au/"
]

### EXERCISE 12b - Adding just one extra bit...

# Print the first five unique urls that contain an .au domain form the list urls (i.e., www.freeview.com.au/ is in there twice)
