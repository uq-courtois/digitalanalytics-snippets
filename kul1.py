### Exercise 1

# 1. Copy/paste these instructions into your Python file 
# 2. Define a list named 'listx' that contains the following integer values: 5, 9, 5, 6, 7, 8
# 3. Sort the list in a descending order (i.e., from large to small)
# 4. Add the integer value 7 to the list
# 5. Define a variable varx that contains the last value of the list 'listx'
# 6. Print the multiplication of varx by 10 to the console
# 7. Print the entire list 'listx' to the console

### Exercise 2

# 1. Copy/paste these instructions into your Python file 
# 2. Define a list named 'listx' that contains the following integer values: 5, 9, 5, 6, 7, 8
# 3. Print each number of listx divided by two 
# 4. Store the divided numbers into a new list ‘listy’
# 5. Print the contents of listy at the end of the program, preceded by the statement ‘The divided numbers are:’

### Exercise 3

# x = ['eric','lisa','lisa','marc,'john,'lisa']
# Write a program that gets rids of x occurences of ‘lisa’ in a list and test it (program should be robust to handle an unknown number of elements ‘lisa’)

### Exercise 4

# 1. Define three variables: length has a value of 2, width has a value of 4, height has a value of 3
# 2. Calculate the volume of this cuboid and print the solution (assuming the values are in m) in cubic meters: ‘The cuboid has a volume of … cubic meters’

### Exercise 5

quotes = [
'The ancients dreaded death: the Christian can only fear dying. (Augustus William Hare)',
'We who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive. (Martin Luther King)',
'I have criticized absent people so often, and then discovered, to my humiliation, that I was talking with their relatives, that I have grown superstitious about that sort of thing and dropped it. (Mark Twain)',
'The injury that we do to a man must be such that we need not fear his vengeance (Steve Perry)'
]

#1 Define a list of sentences
#2 Print the quotes that contain we – Mind you that python is case sensitive. If you want to convert a string into lowercase, use the .lower() method – e.g.:

# var = ‘This is a sentence’
# print(var.lower())
# >>> ‘this is a sentence’
